# Landing Page

Create an interactive navigation menu with a fixed position, visible on all pages. Structure it using HTML, style it with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript. When scrolling or hovering over a menu item, the menu should change color or style. Use a blue gradient for the background, ensuring smooth transitions for a seamless user experience.
